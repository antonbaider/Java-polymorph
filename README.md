## Task 5

Create classes Square and Rectang with method (double getPerimeter()) 
for calculating of perimeter.

---
Find solution for avoiding of duplicate code.

---
Create a double sumPerimeter(List<?> figures) method 
of the MyUtils class to return a sum perimeters of all figures.

---
For example, for a given list

---
* [[Square [width=4.00], 
* Square [width=5.00], 
* Rectang [height=2.00, width=3.00]]

---
you should get 46

---
* Refactor this code so that it does not violate the 'Liskov Substitution Principle'

---
## When you will paste code to Moodle, leave only one public class 'MyUtils'
