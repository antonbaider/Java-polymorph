This sprint contains a few tasks. Unit tests for the tasks are in the separate branches **task1**, **task2**, **task3**....

You can switch between branches using a command
```
 git checkout <branch name>
```
e.g.
```
 git checkout task1
 ```
> Don't forget to commit your code before switching to another branch

In the **main** folder first you need to complete your code with the solution of the tasks

After this uncomment all tests in folder **test** and run the code
```
mvn test
```
or (if you haven't installed Maven on your PC)
```
./mvnw test
```
or just use command `Run` from your IDE
